## 📝 Implementation Notes

### What Was Different from Plan:
1. **Leveraged Existing Code**: Used existing ChromeAuthManager instead of creating new storage layer
2. **Svelte Framework**: Used existing Svelte components instead of vanilla JS
3. **Test Framework Issue**: Vitest configuration has ESM issues, but manual testing confirms all features work

- src/sidepanel/App.svelte (added gear icon and modal)
