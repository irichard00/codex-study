# Feature Specification: Environment-Based AgentConfig Initialization

**Feature Branch**: `004-agentconfig-is-the`
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AgentConfig is the centralized config object that help control, we need to have an env file to initialize AgentConfig object, scan through the code and implement the env file for npm command to read when building the project. also .env.example file is needed, refactor it to make it useful"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the codex-chrome extension, I need to configure the AgentConfig centralized configuration object through environment variables at build time, so that I can easily manage different configuration settings for different deployment environments (development, staging, production) without modifying the source code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has cloned the repository, **When** they copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in their configuration values, **Then** the build process should read these values and initialize AgentConfig with them.

2. **Given** environment variables are defined in `.env` file, **When** running `npm run build`, **Then** the AgentConfig object should be initialized with the environment variable values during the build process.

3. **Given** no `.env` file exists, **When** running the build command, **Then** the system should use default values from the code or fail gracefully with a clear error message indicating missing required configuration.

4. **Given** a `.env.example` file exists with all configurable options documented, **When** a new developer joins the project, **Then** they should be able to understand all available configuration options and their purpose.

5. **Given** sensitive configuration values (API keys, secrets), **When** they are stored in the `.env` file, **Then** they should not be committed to version control and should be properly documented in `.env.example` without actual values.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required environment variables are missing?
- How does system handle invalid values in environment variables?
- What happens when environment variables conflict with runtime configuration?
- How does the system behave when `.env` file is malformed or contains syntax errors?
- What happens when environment variables contain special characters or spaces?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read configuration values from a `.env` file during the build process
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a comprehensive `.env.example` file with all available configuration options documented
- **FR-003**: System MUST initialize the AgentConfig object with values from environment variables
- **FR-004**: System MUST support all existing AgentConfig properties through environment variables (model settings, provider configs, preferences, cache settings, extension settings)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when required configuration is missing or invalid
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT include actual secrets or API keys in the `.env.example` file
- **FR-007**: System MUST use sensible defaults for optional configuration values when not specified in environment variables
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate environment variable values against expected types and formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST support hierarchical configuration (e.g., MODEL_PROVIDER, MODEL_SELECTED, MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW)
- **FR-010**: Build process MUST fail gracefully with helpful error messages when critical configuration is missing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Environment Configuration**: Collection of key-value pairs read from `.env` file that map to AgentConfig properties
- **AgentConfig**: Centralized configuration object that controls all aspects of the extension's behavior
- **Configuration Mapping**: Translation layer between environment variable names and AgentConfig property paths
- **Default Values**: Fallback configuration values used when environment variables are not specified
- **Build-time Configuration**: Configuration values that are embedded into the built extension package
