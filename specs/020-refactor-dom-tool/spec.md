# Feature Specification: Refactor DOMTool to High-Level DOM Reading

**Feature Branch**: `020-refactor-dom-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor dom tool codex-chrome/src/tools/DOMTool.ts, current dom tool is too atomic operation on manipulate each elements of the tab, but we actually want a high level tool that can read the dom as a whole. So refactor the DOMTool.ts to utilize codex-chrome/src/tools/dom/service.ts and remove other current legacy methods"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified need to transition from atomic element operations to holistic DOM reading
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: AI agent, DOMTool, DomService
   ‚Üí Actions: Read entire DOM, serialize DOM state, capture page structure
   ‚Üí Data: DOM tree, accessibility tree, element metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: Remove atomic operations, leverage existing DomService
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should any atomic operations be retained for backward compatibility?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected output format for the high-level DOM reading?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Agent requests full DOM snapshot for page understanding
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí High-level DOM reading capability
   ‚Üí Integration with DomService
   ‚Üí Removal of atomic operation methods
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Serialized DOM state, Enhanced DOM tree
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding backward compatibility and output format"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An AI agent needs to understand the structure and content of a web page to complete tasks like information extraction, form filling, or navigation. Instead of querying individual elements one at a time, the agent should receive a comprehensive snapshot of the entire DOM structure in a single operation, enabling efficient page comprehension and decision-making.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an active browser tab with loaded content, **When** the agent requests DOM information, **Then** the system provides a complete serialized representation of the page structure including all interactive elements, text content, and accessibility metadata
2. **Given** a page with multiple nested iframes and shadow DOM, **When** the agent requests DOM information, **Then** the system returns a unified view that includes content from nested contexts (subject to security constraints)
3. **Given** a page with dynamically updated content, **When** the agent requests DOM information multiple times, **Then** each request returns the current state of the page reflecting any changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the page contains cross-origin iframes that cannot be accessed?
- How does the system handle very large pages (e.g., 10,000+ DOM nodes)?
- What happens if DOM capture is requested while the page is still loading?
- How does the system represent hidden or off-screen elements?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a high-level operation to read the entire DOM structure of a web page in a single request
- **FR-002**: System MUST include element metadata such as visibility, position, accessibility information, and interactive state in the DOM representation
- **FR-003**: System MUST serialize the DOM into a format suitable for AI agent consumption and decision-making
- **FR-004**: System MUST utilize the existing DomService for DOM tree construction, accessibility tree integration, and snapshot capture
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove legacy atomic operation methods (query, click, type, getAttribute, etc.) that operate on individual elements [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should any atomic operations be retained for backward compatibility with existing agent code?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle iframes according to configured limits (max iframe count and depth)
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply visibility and paint order filtering to focus on user-relevant elements
- **FR-008**: System MUST return DOM information within a reasonable timeout [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the acceptable performance target for DOM capture on typical pages?]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The high-level DOM reading operation must complete efficiently even for complex pages
- **NFR-002**: The serialized DOM format must be concise to minimize token usage for AI processing
- **NFR-003**: The tool must maintain compatibility with Chrome extension permissions and security model

### Key Entities
- **Serialized DOM State**: A comprehensive representation of the page structure including element hierarchy, attributes, computed styles, accessibility properties, and position information - formatted for AI consumption
- **Enhanced DOM Tree Node**: A rich node representation that combines DOM node data, accessibility tree information, snapshot metadata, and computed properties like visibility and scrollability
- **Target Information**: Identifies the page or iframe context being captured, including target ID, URL, and frame relationships
