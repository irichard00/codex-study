# Research Findings: Sidepanel Settings with OpenAI API Key Management

**Feature**: 003-currently-in-sidepanel
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary
Research conducted to resolve technical unknowns for implementing settings UI in Chrome extension sidepanel with secure API key management.

## Research Areas

### 1. Settings Interface Presentation
**Decision**: Modal overlay within sidepanel
**Rationale**:
- Maintains context within sidepanel without navigation
- Common pattern in Chrome extensions for settings
- Allows easy dismissal and return to main view
**Alternatives considered**:
- Inline expansion: Too cramped in sidepanel's limited space
- New tab/page: Breaks user flow and context

### 2. API Key Update Mechanism
**Decision**: Replace entire key with update button
**Rationale**:
- Simpler security model - no partial key exposure
- Clear user intent - explicit update action
- Reduces risk of accidental modifications
**Alternatives considered**:
- Inline editing: Security risk with partial key exposure
- Append-only: Confusing UX for corrections

### 3. API Key Deletion
**Decision**: Provide "Clear API Key" button with confirmation
**Rationale**:
- Essential for user control over their data
- Required for testing and troubleshooting
- Privacy requirement for extension uninstall
**Alternatives considered**:
- No deletion: Poor user experience
- Auto-clear on uninstall only: Insufficient control

### 4. OpenAI API Key Validation
**Decision**: Format validation only (sk-... pattern, minimum length)
**Rationale**:
- Avoid unnecessary API calls for validation
- Instant feedback to user
- Sufficient for basic error prevention
**Alternatives considered**:
- Live API validation: Network overhead, rate limits
- No validation: Poor error handling downstream

### 5. User Feedback Mechanism
**Decision**: Inline success/error messages below input
**Rationale**:
- Clear visual association with action
- Non-intrusive to workflow
- Accessible for screen readers
**Alternatives considered**:
- Toast notifications: May be missed or cover content
- Browser notifications: Too heavy for simple feedback

### 6. Storage Error Handling
**Decision**: Fallback to memory with user warning
**Rationale**:
- Maintains functionality even with storage issues
- Clear communication about persistence risk
- Allows debugging of storage problems
**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard failure: Poor user experience
- Silent failure: Data loss without user awareness

## Technical Decisions

### Chrome Storage API Usage
- Use `chrome.storage.local` for persistence
- Implement storage quota monitoring
- Handle QUOTA_EXCEEDED errors gracefully
- Encrypt keys before storage using Chrome's built-in encryption

### UI Implementation
- Use native HTML/CSS for consistency with existing sidepanel
- Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Add ARIA labels for screen reader support
- Use CSS transitions for smooth modal appearance

### Security Considerations
- Never log API keys even in development
- Clear clipboard after paste operations
- Implement rate limiting for storage operations
- Add CSP headers to prevent injection attacks

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required Chrome APIs
- `chrome.storage.local`: Key persistence
- `chrome.runtime`: Extension lifecycle events
- `chrome.tabs`: Optional for future API testing

### Development Tools
- TypeScript: Already configured in project
- Testing: Use existing npm test setup
- Build: Existing webpack configuration sufficient

## Performance Considerations
- Storage operations: <10ms typical latency
- UI rendering: <16ms for 60fps animations
- Memory: Minimal overhead (~1KB per key)
- Initial load: No impact on sidepanel startup

## Resolved Clarifications

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved:
1. **Settings presentation**: Modal overlay
2. **Update mechanism**: Replace with confirmation
3. **Delete capability**: Clear button with confirmation
4. **Validation rules**: Format check (sk-..., 40+ chars)
5. **Feedback type**: Inline messages
6. **Storage errors**: Fallback with warning

## Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts with all technical decisions finalized.
