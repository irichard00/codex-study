# Feature Specification: Sidepanel Settings with OpenAI API Key Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-currently-in-sidepanel`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "currently in sidepanel page, on the bottom, we should add a gear icon with tooktip \"setting\", when user click it, it will show openAI's apikey (only show first 6 letter of the key, rest of the key content should be hidden by three start annotation ***). Also if user currently doesn't have openai api key, we should add a button \"add api key\" that allow user to click, when user click the button, record the api key into openai_apikey.json and store into chrome.storage.local"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the sidepanel extension, I want to manage my OpenAI API key settings through a dedicated settings interface accessible via a gear icon at the bottom of the sidepanel, so that I can securely configure and update my API credentials without exposing the full key.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has the sidepanel open, **When** they hover over the gear icon at the bottom, **Then** they see a tooltip displaying "setting"
2. **Given** the user clicks the gear icon, **When** they have an API key stored, **Then** they see the first 6 characters of their API key followed by *** masking
3. **Given** the user clicks the gear icon, **When** they have no API key stored, **Then** they see an "add api key" button
4. **Given** the user sees the "add api key" button, **When** they click it, **Then** they can enter their API key which gets saved persistently
5. **Given** the user has entered an API key, **When** they reload the extension or browser, **Then** their API key remains stored and accessible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters an invalid API key format? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validation rules for API key format not specified]
- How does system handle when user wants to update an existing API key? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update mechanism not specified]
- What happens when storage quota is exceeded?
- How does system handle when user wants to delete their API key? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: deletion mechanism not specified]
- What happens when multiple tabs/windows have the sidepanel open simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a gear icon at the bottom of the sidepanel page
- **FR-002**: System MUST show tooltip text "setting" when user hovers over the gear icon
- **FR-003**: System MUST display settings interface when user clicks the gear icon
- **FR-004**: System MUST mask stored API keys by showing only the first 6 characters followed by ***
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an "add api key" button when no API key exists
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow user to input an API key when "add api key" button is clicked
- **FR-007**: System MUST persistently store the API key in local storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST retrieve and display the masked API key from storage when settings are opened
- **FR-009**: Settings interface MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should settings open inline, in modal, or new view?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should user be able to edit/update existing API key?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should user be able to delete/clear API key?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle API key validation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes a valid OpenAI API key format?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide feedback when API key is successfully saved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what type of feedback - toast, inline message, etc?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle storage errors gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what should happen if storage fails?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **OpenAI API Key**: User's authentication credential for OpenAI services, stored securely with masking for display
- **Settings State**: Current configuration including whether API key exists and its masked representation
- **Storage Entry**: Persistent data structure containing the API key information
