# Feature Specification: Side Panel UI Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `014-improve-side-panel`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Improve side panel UI in following:
1.  The user's input should be recorded into the chat dialogue as well, the color of user input should be blue
2. for "Enter command", there should be a outline to make it more be like an user input box
3. Change the label "Codex Terminal v1.0.0" into "Codex For Chrome v1.0.0 (By AI Republic)""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úì Three distinct UI improvements identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Chrome extension users
   ‚Üí Actions: View chat history, enter commands, identify extension version
   ‚Üí Data: User input messages, chat dialogue history
   ‚Üí Constraints: Visual styling (blue color, outline border), branding text
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No ambiguities - all requirements are specific
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úì Clear user flows for all three improvements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì All requirements testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí N/A - UI-only changes
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úì No implementation details in requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user opens the Codex Chrome extension side panel and interacts with the agent. They want to:
1. See their own typed commands displayed in the chat history (colored blue for easy distinction)
2. Clearly identify the command input field (with a visible border/outline)
3. Know which version and branding of the extension they're using

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the side panel is open, **When** the user types a command and submits it, **Then** the command appears in the chat dialogue above the input box, displayed in blue text
2. **Given** the side panel is displayed, **When** the user views the command input field, **Then** the input field has a visible outline/border to indicate it's an interactive element
3. **Given** the side panel is loaded, **When** the user looks at the top status line, **Then** the label reads "Codex For Chrome v1.0.0 (By AI Republic)" instead of "Codex Terminal v1.0.0"
4. **Given** multiple messages in the chat, **When** the user scrolls through the dialogue, **Then** user messages (blue) are visually distinct from agent messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the chat dialogue is empty? (The welcome message should still appear, input field should still have outline)
- How does the blue color appear in both light and dark themes? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a theme system, or single color theme?]
- What happens when user submits multiple rapid messages? (All should appear in order, all in blue)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display user-submitted input messages in the chat dialogue area
- **FR-002**: User input messages MUST be visually distinct from agent messages by displaying in blue color
- **FR-003**: The command input field MUST have a visible outline/border to indicate it is an interactive input element
- **FR-004**: The side panel header label MUST display "Codex For Chrome v1.0.0 (By AI Republic)" instead of "Codex Terminal v1.0.0"
- **FR-005**: User messages MUST appear in chronological order within the chat dialogue
- **FR-006**: User messages MUST persist in the chat dialogue when new agent responses arrive
- **FR-007**: The input field outline MUST be visible in all visual states (empty, focused, filled)
