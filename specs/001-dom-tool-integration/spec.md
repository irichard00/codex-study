# Feature Specification: DOM Tool Integration for Chrome Extension Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-dom-tool-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "currently codex-chrome/ is in browser agent that runs in chrome, we want to create a tool that allow the agent to operate the dom, codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom_python is the original dom tool that from broswer use project: https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use, it is implemented in python using chrome devtools protocol, we turned it into chrome extension native tool codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom, this task is to do 2 things
1. inspect if the conversion from codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom_python to codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom is complete, and it is ready to be used as tool for the agent to operate the browser tabs and page doms
2. after inspect and improve the codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom, refactor the code codex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/DOMTool.ts to adopt odex-study/codex-chrome/src/tools/dom functionalities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a browser automation agent, I need to interact with web page elements through DOM manipulation capabilities so that I can perform automated tasks like clicking buttons, filling forms, extracting text, and navigating web applications without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a web page is loaded in a browser tab, **When** the agent requests to query DOM elements by CSS selector, **Then** the system returns a list of matching elements with their properties and attributes
2. **Given** a specific element is identified on a page, **When** the agent requests to click that element, **Then** the system performs the click action and reports success or failure
3. **Given** a text input field exists on a page, **When** the agent requests to type text into that field, **Then** the system enters the text and confirms the action
4. **Given** a web page with multiple frames/iframes, **When** the agent requests to interact with elements inside frames, **Then** the system can access and manipulate elements within those frames
5. **Given** dynamic content that loads after page load, **When** the agent requests to wait for specific elements, **Then** the system waits until elements appear or timeout occurs
6. **Given** a page with scrollable content, **When** the agent requests to scroll to a specific element, **Then** the system scrolls the element into view
7. **Given** a form on a web page, **When** the agent requests to fill multiple form fields, **Then** the system populates all specified fields with provided data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to interact with elements that are hidden or disabled?
- How does system handle cross-origin iframe restrictions?
- What occurs when elements are removed from DOM during interaction attempts?
- How does system respond to network delays or slow-loading pages?
- What happens when multiple elements match a selector but only one is expected?
- How does system handle elements that require special interactions (e.g., select dropdowns, file inputs)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide capability to query DOM elements using CSS selectors
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable clicking on page elements (buttons, links, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow typing text into input fields and text areas
- **FR-004**: System MUST support reading element attributes and properties
- **FR-005**: System MUST support modifying element attributes
- **FR-006**: System MUST extract text content from elements
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract HTML content from elements
- **FR-008**: System MUST support form submission actions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide element focus capabilities
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable scrolling to specific elements
- **FR-011**: System MUST wait for elements to appear with configurable timeouts
- **FR-012**: System MUST check element visibility status
- **FR-013**: System MUST extract all links from a page or specific area
- **FR-014**: System MUST fill entire forms with provided data mappings
- **FR-015**: System MUST execute multiple DOM actions in sequence
- **FR-016**: System MUST capture full DOM tree structure with computed styles
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate accessibility tree information
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle iframe and frame interactions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: extent of cross-origin support required?]
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide element bounding box and position information
- **FR-020**: System MUST detect clickable elements automatically
- **FR-021**: System MUST handle paint order for overlapping elements
- **FR-022**: System MUST serialize DOM state for analysis
- **FR-023**: System MUST validate element interactability before actions
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide detailed error messages for failed actions
- **FR-025**: System MUST support batch operations for efficiency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance requirements?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **DOM Element**: Represents a single element in the page structure with its tag, attributes, text content, position, and computed styles
- **DOM Tree**: Complete hierarchical structure of page elements with parent-child relationships
- **Accessibility Node**: Enhanced element representation with accessibility properties and roles
- **Element Selector**: Query string (CSS selector or XPath) used to identify elements
- **Action Result**: Outcome of a DOM manipulation action including success status, affected elements, and any error details
- **Page Snapshot**: Captured state of the entire DOM at a point in time including styles and layout
- **Frame Context**: Information about iframe/frame containers and their content accessibility
