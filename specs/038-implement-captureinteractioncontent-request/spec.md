# Feature Specification: Capture Interaction Content for Browser AI Agent

**Feature Branch**: `038-implement-captureinteractioncontent-request`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement captureInteractionContent(request) in codex-chrome/src/tools/DOMTool.ts which will return the given tab web page's interaction information.

Context:
codex-chrome/ is a in browser extension AI agent app, it help execute user's tasks in web page by simulating human's operation in browser.

currently we have codex-chrome/src/tools/dom/service.ts and captureDOM() method that help to build a serialized content based on the dom and serialization logic. However, the serialization logic currently is not working correctly. We want to have an alternative method captureInteractionContent() to convert the given target tab web page's source html code into a page model that captures just what a human needs:
Structure: headings and landmarks (main/nav/aside/dialog).
Interactive controls: for each actionable element, include:
role (button, link, textbox, checkbox, radio, combobox, menuitem‚Ä¶)
name (computed accessible name)
key states (disabled, checked, expanded, required)
a stable id (for the LLM to reference)
your selector (kept out of the LLM token path, but sent in a small map)
Context text: the main article/section text (reader-view style) in plain text.
Actionability hints: visible? in viewport? bounding box.
Privacy: never include raw field values; use value_len"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: How should iframe content be handled in the page model? ‚Üí A: Include same-origin iframes only (1 level deep), with extensible design for future multi-level support
- Q: What is the acceptable timeout for page model generation? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds - very patient, suitable for extremely large pages
- Q: What is the target token budget for the resulting page model? ‚Üí A: No strict limit - rely on element caps, but prioritize maximum interactive information density with minimal token consumption
- Q: Should captureInteractionContent() replace the existing captureDOM() method or run alongside it? ‚Üí A: New primary method with captureDOM() kept as wrapper for backward compatibility (captureDOM() currently broken, planned for future fixes)
- Q: Should the implementation use the dom-accessibility-api library for accessible name computation? ‚Üí A: Yes - use dom-accessibility-api library (standards-compliant, well-tested, Chrome APIs don't offer better alternative)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
An AI agent operating within a browser extension needs to understand the current state of a web page to execute user tasks. The agent must receive a compact, token-efficient representation of the page that focuses on:
- Page structure (headings, landmarks) for orientation
- Interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) with their current states
- Visual actionability (what's visible and clickable)
- Sufficient context to make intelligent decisions about which elements to interact with

The representation must be privacy-preserving (no actual form values exposed) and optimized for LLM token consumption, similar to how a human would describe a page's interactive elements to another person.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a login page with email/password fields and a "Sign In" button, **When** the agent requests page interaction content, **Then** the system returns a compact model containing:
   - Heading "Login" or similar orientation marker
   - Two textbox controls with accessible names "Email" and "Password"
   - Each textbox showing states (required: true, value_len: number, placeholder text)
   - One button control with name "Sign In"
   - Stable IDs for each control (e.g., "te_1", "te_2", "bu_3")
   - Selector map kept separate from LLM-facing content

2. **Given** a complex e-commerce page with 200+ elements, **When** the agent requests page interaction content, **Then** the system returns:
   - Only visible, actionable elements (filters hidden/off-screen items)
   - Primary landmarks (main content, navigation, search)
   - Top-level headings for page structure
   - Interactive controls capped at reasonable limit (e.g., 400 most relevant)
   - Bounding box information to indicate viewport position
   - Total token count suitable for LLM context window

3. **Given** a form with sensitive information (password field with value "secret123"), **When** the agent requests page interaction content, **Then** the system returns:
   - Textbox control for password field
   - State showing value_len: 9 (character count only)
   - NO actual password value included
   - Placeholder text if present
   - Required/disabled/checked states as applicable

4. **Given** a page with dynamic content (checkboxes, expanded/collapsed sections), **When** the agent requests page interaction content, **Then** the system returns:
   - Current state of each checkbox (checked: true/false)
   - Current state of expandable sections (expanded: true/false)
   - Disabled state for any non-interactive controls
   - Visual indicators (in viewport, visible, bounding box dimensions)

5. **Given** a page with nested regions (navigation inside header, form inside main), **When** the agent requests page interaction content, **Then** the system returns:
   - Each control tagged with its containing region (region: "main", region: "navigation")
   - Clear landmark structure (regions: ["main", "navigation", "header"])
   - Hierarchical context preserved for decision-making

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a page has no interactive elements?**
  System should return minimal model with headings and regions only, controls array empty.

- **What happens when page has iframes with interactive content?**
  System should include same-origin iframe content at 1 level deep only; cross-origin iframes are excluded due to security restrictions; design must support configurable depth for future enhancement.

- **What happens when computed accessible name is empty or ambiguous?**
  System should fall back to element text content, aria-label, or placeholder; include empty string if no name available.

- **What happens when multiple elements have identical selectors?**
  System should generate unique stable IDs regardless of selector quality; selector map may have collision but IDs won't.

- **What happens when page is still loading/rendering?**
  System should capture current DOM state without waiting; if page is actively rendering, capture reflects moment of invocation; 30-second timeout applies to capture operation itself, not page load completion.

- **How does system handle very large pages (thousands of elements)?**
  System should enforce maxControls cap (default 400) and maxHeadings cap (default 30) as specified.

- **What happens when element has multiple ARIA roles or conflicting states?**
  System should use explicit role attribute first, then implicit HTML semantics; prioritize ARIA states over HTML attributes.

## Areas Requiring Clarification

All critical clarifications have been resolved in Session 2025-10-14. Remaining open question:

1. **Maximum Page Size**: What is the maximum HTML size the system should handle? Should there be size-based rejection?
   - **Impact**: Low - Element caps (400 controls, 30 headings) and 30-second timeout provide effective size management
   - **Recommendation**: Defer to implementation phase; graceful degradation via caps is sufficient

---

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 95%+ of interactive elements correctly identified with proper roles and names
- **Privacy Compliance**: 100% of sensitive field values redacted (zero actual passwords/form values in output)
- **Token Efficiency**: Maximum interactive information density per token - measured by (actionable elements captured) / (total tokens consumed)
- **Coverage**: Support for 20+ interactive element types (button, link, textbox, checkbox, radio, combobox, menuitem, etc.)
- **Reliability**: Graceful degradation on malformed HTML (no crashes, always return valid model)
- **Actionability Accuracy**: 90%+ of returned elements successfully actionable by execution layer using provided selectors
