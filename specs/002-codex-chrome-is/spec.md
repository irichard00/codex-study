# Feature Specification: AgentConfig Integration for Codex Chrome Extension

**Feature Branch**: `002-codex-chrome-is`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs, it is converted from rust into typescript and codex-chrome is a chrome extension agent that run in browser, and codex-chrome/src/config/AgentConfig.ts is converted from codex-rs/core/src/config.rs, however the AgentConfig is not used in the code, scan through the original codex-rs/ folder and analyze how struct Config is used in the project, and apply the same logic into codex-chrome"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract requirement: Integrate AgentConfig into codex-chrome following codex-rs patterns
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: AgentConfig class exists but unused, needs Arc-like pattern from Rust
   ‚Üí Identified: Config dependency injection pattern needs implementation
   ‚Üí Identified: Component initialization with Config references
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Config persistence mechanism for browser environment determined
   ‚Üí Component dependency patterns analyzed from codex-rs
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow for configuration usage defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement based on codex-rs Config usage patterns
6. Identify Key Entities (configuration data model)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Codex Chrome extension, I need the configuration system to control all agent behavior consistently throughout the extension, just like in the original codex-rs implementation, so that I can customize model selection, tool availability, security policies, and other runtime behaviors through a centralized configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the extension is loaded, **When** it starts, **Then** AgentConfig loads stored configuration or applies defaults
2. **Given** a user changes the model selection, **When** the change is saved, **Then** all components receive the updated model configuration
3. **Given** security policies are configured, **When** the agent executes operations, **Then** it respects the configured approval and sandbox policies
4. **Given** tool configurations are set, **When** the agent processes tasks, **Then** only enabled tools are available for use
5. **Given** multiple components need configuration, **When** they initialize, **Then** they receive the same shared configuration instance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when stored configuration is corrupted or invalid?
- How does system handle configuration migration when version changes?
- What happens when a component requests configuration before initialization completes?
- How does the system handle concurrent configuration updates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize AgentConfig as a singleton instance shared across all components
- **FR-002**: System MUST pass AgentConfig references to all components that require configuration (CodexAgent, ModelClientFactory, Session, TaskRunner, ToolRegistry)
- **FR-003**: Components MUST receive configuration at initialization time through constructor parameters or initialization methods
- **FR-004**: System MUST use AgentConfig to control model selection and provider configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST use AgentConfig to control security policies (approval policy, sandbox policy)
- **FR-006**: System MUST use AgentConfig to control tool availability (enable/disable specific tools)
- **FR-007**: System MUST use AgentConfig to manage working directory context for operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST use AgentConfig to control UI display preferences (hide/show reasoning, notifications)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support runtime configuration updates with proper event propagation
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist configuration changes to browser storage
- **FR-011**: Components MUST react to configuration changes that affect their behavior
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide configuration to background service worker, content scripts, and side panel
- **FR-013**: System MUST support profile-based configuration overrides
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate configuration changes before applying them
- **FR-015**: System MUST support per-turn configuration cloning for dynamic model switching

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AgentConfig**: Central configuration service managing all extension settings, tool enablement, security policies, and model configuration
- **ConfigConsumer Components**: Components that depend on configuration (CodexAgent, ModelClientFactory, Session, TaskRunner, ToolRegistry, ApprovalManager)
- **Configuration Sections**: Model settings, provider configurations, security policies, tool flags, UI preferences, profile settings
- **Configuration Events**: Change notifications when configuration is updated
- **Configuration Storage**: Browser-based persistence layer for configuration data
