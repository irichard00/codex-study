# Feature Specification: Implement Missing Session Methods from codex-rs

**Feature Branch**: `008-implement-the-missing`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement the missing methods in codex-chrome/src/core/Session.ts from impl Session in codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Scope: Port missing methods from Rust Session to TypeScript Session
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: TypeScript Session class, Rust reference implementation
   ‚Üí Actions: Port methods, maintain API compatibility
   ‚Üí Data: Conversation state, turn management, rollout recording
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must preserve SQ/EQ architecture, SessionState integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific methods are considered "missing"?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should async/await patterns match TypeScript conventions?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there TypeScript-specific adaptations needed for Rust patterns?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: Developer ports Session methods to maintain feature parity
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Session, SessionState, ActiveTurn, RolloutRecorder
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed on specific method subset"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working on the Codex Chrome Extension needs the TypeScript Session class to have the same capabilities as the Rust reference implementation. By porting the missing methods from `codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs`, the Chrome extension will support the full conversation management, turn handling, and rollout recording features that the Rust version provides.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a TypeScript Session instance, **When** methods for conversation management are called, **Then** they must behave identically to the Rust implementation
2. **Given** an active turn in progress, **When** turn-related methods are invoked, **Then** they must correctly manage turn state and pending input
3. **Given** conversation history needs to be reconstructed, **When** rollout items are processed, **Then** the history must match the Rust reconstruction logic
4. **Given** approval requests are made during tool execution, **When** approval methods are called, **Then** they must integrate with the ActiveTurn approval workflow
5. **Given** token usage and rate limits are updated, **When** tracking methods are invoked, **Then** they must correctly update SessionState and emit events
6. **Given** MCP tools are available, **When** tool methods are called, **Then** they must integrate with the MCP connection manager
7. **Given** a session needs to be shut down, **When** cleanup methods are invoked, **Then** they must flush rollout recorder and release resources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a method is called while no active turn exists?
- How does the system handle reconstruction of history with compacted items?
- What happens when rollout persistence fails during critical operations?
- How does the system handle approval requests when the ActiveTurn is null?
- What happens when interrupts are requested during tool execution?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide methods for recording conversation items to history and rollout
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement turn lifecycle methods (start, end, inject input, get pending input)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide approval request methods for command and patch operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement token usage tracking and rate limit updates
- **FR-005**: System MUST support history reconstruction from rollout items
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide methods for building initial context and turn input with history
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement MCP tool integration methods (get tools, call tool)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide interrupt handling for active tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement rollout persistence methods matching codex-rs patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide methods for notifying approval decisions
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement event sending with rollout persistence
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide methods for updating and sending token count events
- **FR-013**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should all methods be ported, or only a specific subset?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should TypeScript-specific error handling be added beyond Rust patterns?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Core class managing conversation state, turn lifecycle, and rollout recording
- **SessionState**: Pure data container for conversation history, token usage, and approved commands
- **ActiveTurn**: Manages active turn state including pending input and approval callbacks
- **SessionServices**: Collection of services (rollout recorder, MCP manager, notifier)
- **RolloutRecorder**: Handles persistence of conversation items and events to storage
- **TurnContext**: Configuration and context for individual conversation turns
- **ResponseItem**: Individual conversation history items (messages, tool calls, results)
- **RolloutItem**: Persistence format for rollout recording (response items, events, metadata)
