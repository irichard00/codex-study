# Feature Specification: Rollout Logic in codex-chrome/src/storage

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-rollout-logic`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement rollout logic in codex-chrome/src/storage"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: rollout logic for storage
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: gradual feature rollout, percentage-based distribution, user cohorts, feature flags
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What triggers should activate rollout logic?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should rollout percentages be configurable per-feature or global?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should users be assigned to cohorts - random, user ID hash, or other criteria?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should rollout state persist across browser sessions?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What data should be tracked about rollout status for analytics?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: developer enables feature for subset of users
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements generated with clarification markers
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Entities: RolloutConfig, UserCohort, FeatureFlag
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 5 clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Development teams need to gradually roll out new storage features to users to minimize risk and monitor impact. A developer configures a new feature to be enabled for 10% of users initially, then increases to 50% after monitoring shows stability, and finally rolls out to 100% of users.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new storage feature is ready for testing, **When** a developer sets rollout to 10%, **Then** only 10% of users see the new feature while others continue with existing behavior
2. **Given** a feature is rolled out to 25% of users, **When** a user checks feature availability multiple times, **Then** the same user consistently receives the same feature state (enabled or disabled)
3. **Given** a feature rollout percentage is increased from 25% to 75%, **When** users access the extension, **Then** approximately 75% of total users see the new feature
4. **Given** multiple features have different rollout percentages, **When** the system evaluates feature flags, **Then** each feature is evaluated independently based on its own rollout configuration
5. **Given** a feature is fully rolled out at 100%, **When** rollout is complete, **Then** the feature flag can be safely removed and feature becomes permanent

### Edge Cases
- What happens when rollout percentage is changed while users are actively using the extension?
- How does system handle rollout state when browser storage is cleared?
- What happens if rollout configuration becomes corrupted or invalid?
- How are new users assigned to cohorts when they first install the extension?
- What happens when a feature rollout is rolled back from higher to lower percentage?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support percentage-based feature rollout (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign users to consistent cohorts so the same user always sees the same feature state for a given configuration
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow independent rollout percentages for different storage features
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist rollout state and user cohort assignments across browser sessions
- **FR-005**: System MUST support rollout percentage changes without requiring user action or extension reload
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a way to check if a specific feature is enabled for the current user
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle rollout percentages from 0% (completely disabled) to 100% (fully enabled)
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: support emergency kill switch to instantly disable features?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: track rollout analytics - which users have which features enabled?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: support A/B testing with multiple variants, or only binary enabled/disabled?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: allow targeting specific user segments (e.g., beta testers, specific domains)?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validate rollout configurations to prevent invalid percentages or conflicts?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **RolloutConfig**: Represents the configuration for a feature rollout, including feature identifier, target percentage, and rollout strategy parameters
- **UserCohort**: Represents which cohort a user belongs to for consistent feature assignment, includes user identifier and cohort assignment algorithm results
- **FeatureFlag**: Represents the current state of a feature for a specific user, combining RolloutConfig with UserCohort to determine if feature is enabled
- **RolloutState**: Tracks the overall rollout status including current percentage, number of users in each cohort, and rollout history
