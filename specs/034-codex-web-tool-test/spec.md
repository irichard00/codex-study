# Feature Specification: Codex Web Tool Test Extension

**Feature Branch**: `034-codex-web-tool-test`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a test tool under codex-chrome/tests/tools/e2e, the test tool is a standalone chrome extension side panel app, the app's name is \"Codex Web Tool Test\", which has webpage in side panel..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: standalone test tool, side panel app, tool simulation interface
2. Identify key capabilities
   ‚Üí Tool listing from ToolRegistry
   ‚Üí Manual parameter input interface
   ‚Üí Tool execution simulation
   ‚Üí Navigation between views
3. Define user flows
   ‚Üí Browse available tools
   ‚Üí Select tool and view details
   ‚Üí Input parameters and execute
   ‚Üí View results
4. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Tool discovery and listing
   ‚Üí Parameter input forms
   ‚Üí Execution request composition
   ‚Üí Result display
5. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Tool definitions, execution requests, execution responses
6. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Ensure testability and clarity
7. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs to test individual web tools (browser capabilities exposed to the AI agent) without running the full AI agent system. They open the test extension's side panel, browse available tools registered in the ToolRegistry, select a specific tool, manually input the required parameters as they would be provided by an LLM, execute the tool, and observe the results. This enables rapid iteration and debugging of individual tool implementations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the test extension is installed and the side panel is opened, **When** the user first views the interface, **Then** they see a list of all available tools from the ToolRegistry with their names and descriptions
2. **Given** a list of available tools is displayed, **When** the user clicks on a specific tool, **Then** they navigate to a tool detail page showing parameter requirements and an example execution request
3. **Given** the user is on a tool detail page, **When** they fill in the required parameters and click "Execute", **Then** the system composes a ToolExecutionRequest and calls the ToolRegistry's execute method, displaying the response
4. **Given** the user is on a tool detail page, **When** they click the back/navigation control, **Then** they return to the tool selection list
5. **Given** a tool execution completes, **When** the response is received, **Then** the user sees both success/failure status and any returned data or error messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no tools are registered in the ToolRegistry? Display message indicating no tools available
- How does the system handle tool execution failures or timeouts? Display error information including error code and message
- What if a tool requires complex nested parameters? Provide JSON text input as fallback for complex parameter structures
- How are tool execution results that contain large data payloads displayed? Show formatted JSON with ability to expand/collapse sections

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a list of all registered tools from the ToolRegistry on initial load
- **FR-002**: System MUST show tool name and description for each available tool in the list
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select a tool from the list to view its details
- **FR-004**: System MUST display tool parameter schema/requirements on the tool detail page
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an example ToolExecutionRequest for the selected tool
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to input values for all tool parameters on the tool detail page
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an "Execute" button that triggers tool execution via ToolRegistry.execute()
- **FR-008**: System MUST compose a valid ToolExecutionRequest with user-provided parameters when executing
- **FR-009**: System MUST display execution results including success status and response data
- **FR-010**: System MUST display error information when tool execution fails
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to navigate back from tool detail page to tool selection list
- **FR-012**: System MUST isolate test extension code from the main AI agent application code
- **FR-013**: System MUST reuse the same tool registration logic (initializeBrowserTools) from the main application
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a separate build process that outputs test extension artifacts to a dedicated directory
- **FR-015**: System MUST use minimal CSS styling to keep package size small

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tool Definition**: Represents a registered browser tool with name, description, and parameter schema from ToolRegistry
- **Tool Execution Request**: Contains tool name, parameters, session ID, turn ID, and optional timeout for execution
- **Tool Execution Response**: Contains success status, result data (on success), or error information (on failure), and execution duration
- **Available Tools Collection**: The set of all tools currently registered in the ToolRegistry instance
