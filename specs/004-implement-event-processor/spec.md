**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-event-processor`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement event processor in side panel, codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs/, it is converted from rust into typescript and codex-chrome is a chrome extension agent that run in browser, this task is to implement event processor in side panel UI, turning the event messages into human readable information and render it in UI."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users interact with the Codex Chrome extension through a side panel interface. As the agent processes user requests, it generates various event messages containing technical information about task execution, tool calls, reasoning, errors, and status updates. Users need these event messages transformed into clear, human-readable information displayed in the side panel UI so they can understand what the agent is doing, track progress, identify issues, and review results without needing to interpret raw technical event data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the agent starts processing a user request, **When** a TaskStarted event is received, **Then** the UI displays a clear status indicator showing the task has begun with relevant context (model being used, working directory)

2. **Given** the agent is executing a tool or command, **When** tool execution events are received (McpToolCallBegin, ExecCommandBegin, etc.), **Then** the UI displays what tool is being used and what operation is being performed in plain language

3. **Given** the agent generates streaming message content, **When** AgentMessageDelta events arrive, **Then** the UI progressively displays the message content with visual indicators that streaming is active

4. **Given** the agent encounters an error, **When** an Error or StreamError event is received, **Then** the UI displays the error message prominently with clear visual distinction from normal messages

5. **Given** a task completes successfully, **When** a TaskComplete event is received, **Then** the UI displays completion status with summary information (token usage, turn count, duration)

6. **Given** the agent performs reasoning, **When** AgentReasoning or AgentReasoningDelta events arrive, **Then** the UI displays the reasoning content distinctly from regular messages so users can understand the agent's thought process

7. **Given** the agent requests approval for a command or patch, **When** ExecApprovalRequest or ApplyPatchApprovalRequest events are received, **Then** the UI displays the approval request with the command/patch details and clear options for user response

8. **Given** the agent updates a task plan, **When** a PlanUpdate event is received, **Then** the UI displays the current task list with status indicators for each task (pending, in progress, completed)

9. **Given** multiple events arrive rapidly, **When** events are being processed continuously, **Then** the UI remains responsive and organizes information logically without overwhelming the user

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an event arrives with missing or incomplete data fields? System must handle gracefully without crashing, displaying available information and indicating what is missing.
- How does the system handle very long message content or command outputs? Content must be truncated or scrollable to prevent UI overflow.
- What happens when events arrive out of expected sequence? System should render each event independently without assuming strict ordering.
- How does the UI handle rapid-fire delta events for streaming content? Updates should be batched for performance while maintaining smooth visual feedback.
- What happens when an event type is received that isn't yet supported? System should display a generic message indicating an event occurred with basic event type information.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST process all event message types from the agent event queue and determine appropriate UI representation for each type

- **FR-002**: System MUST transform technical event data into human-readable text that clearly explains what the agent is doing

- **FR-003**: System MUST display task lifecycle events (TaskStarted, TaskComplete, TaskFailed) with clear visual indicators distinguishing between start, completion, and failure states

- **FR-004**: System MUST display agent messages and reasoning content with formatting that preserves structure (code blocks, lists, emphasis) for readability

- **FR-005**: System MUST progressively render streaming content (AgentMessageDelta, AgentReasoningDelta) as events arrive, providing visual feedback that content is being generated in real-time

- **FR-006**: System MUST distinguish between different message types visually (agent messages, user messages, system notifications, errors, warnings, tool outputs, reasoning)

- **FR-007**: System MUST display error events (Error, StreamError, TaskFailed) with prominent visual styling that draws user attention

- **FR-008**: System MUST display tool execution events (McpToolCallBegin/End, ExecCommandBegin/End, WebSearchBegin/End, PatchApplyBegin/End) showing what operation is being performed and its outcome

- **FR-009**: System MUST display command output incrementally as ExecCommandOutputDelta events arrive, distinguishing stdout from stderr

- **FR-010**: System MUST display approval requests (ExecApprovalRequest, ApplyPatchApprovalRequest) with the content requiring approval clearly formatted and approval actions easily accessible

- **FR-011**: System MUST display token usage information when TokenCount events are received, showing input/output/cached token counts and context window utilization

- **FR-012**: System MUST display plan updates showing task status (pending, in progress, completed) when PlanUpdate events are received

- **FR-013**: System MUST display notifications (NotificationEvent) with appropriate visual priority based on notification type

- **FR-014**: System MUST handle events with missing or incomplete data without crashing, displaying available information and gracefully handling missing fields

- **FR-015**: System MUST organize events chronologically in the UI so users can follow the sequence of agent actions

- **FR-016**: System MUST support scrolling through event history when content exceeds visible area

- **FR-017**: System MUST provide timestamps for events to help users understand timing and duration of operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should timestamps show relative time (e.g., "2 seconds ago") or absolute time, or both as an option?]

- **FR-018**: System MUST batch rapid UI updates for streaming content to maintain performance without degrading user experience

- **FR-019**: System MUST maintain UI responsiveness during heavy event processing, preventing interface freezing or lag [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what is the acceptable latency threshold for UI updates?]

- **FR-020**: Users MUST be able to distinguish between events from the current task and historical events [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should the UI clear previous task events when a new task starts, or maintain full history?]

### Key Entities

- **Event Message**: A structured data object from the agent containing type identifier and event-specific payload data that needs to be transformed into UI-appropriate content

- **Processed UI Event**: The human-readable representation of an event message including display text, visual styling category (normal, warning, error, system, tool, reasoning), timestamp, and any interactive elements required

- **Event Stream**: Sequence of related events that together represent a single operation (e.g., TaskStarted ‚Üí multiple deltas ‚Üí TaskComplete)

- **Approval Request**: Special event type requiring user interaction, containing operation details and response options

- **Task Plan**: Structured list of tasks with status indicators, updated through PlanUpdate events
