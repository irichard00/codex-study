# Feature Specification: Web Agent System Prompt Adaptation

**Feature Branch**: `003-codex-chrome-is`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs/, it is converted from terminal run coding agent into in broswer web agent that when a user send a query, it will utilize the web pages to finish the query or cmd. Since it is a web page agent, currently, it doesn't have MCP or any file reading tools, all the related tools are web page opreation related, they are currently located in codex-chrome/src/tools. Now codex-rs/core/gpt_5_codex_prompt.md is the system prompt template to guide the agent to work, now we need to turn it into the system prompt for the codex-chrome/ for the web agent. Scan through the code of codex-rs/ and do some research of how the system prompt can be composed and also implement the code to use the system prompt same as original codex-rs/"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Convert terminal-based coding agent prompt to web agent prompt
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Web agent, users submitting queries
   ‚Üí Actions: Web page operations, query processing
   ‚Üí Data: System prompts, tool definitions
   ‚Üí Constraints: No MCP, no file tools, browser-only environment
3. Analyze prompt composition in codex-rs
   ‚Üí Identify model family handling
   ‚Üí Identify base/user instructions pattern
   ‚Üí Map prompt integration points
4. Create web-specific prompt template
   ‚Üí Replace file operations with DOM operations
   ‚Üí Replace shell commands with web actions
   ‚Üí Adapt sandboxing to browser security model
5. Implement prompt loading system
   ‚Üí Match codex-rs architecture pattern
   ‚Üí Integrate with ModelClient
   ‚Üí Support model-specific variations
6. Validate implementation
   ‚Üí Ensure backward compatibility
   ‚Üí Test with existing web tools
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements must be testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Codex Chrome Extension, I want the web agent to understand its role and capabilities through a comprehensive system prompt, so that it can effectively navigate web pages, interact with DOM elements, and complete tasks using browser-specific tools rather than terminal commands.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user query about web page interaction, **When** the agent processes the query, **Then** it uses web-specific instructions and tools (DOM manipulation, navigation, form automation) instead of terminal commands
2. **Given** the web agent is initialized, **When** it loads its system prompt, **Then** it receives browser-specific instructions that guide it to use web tools and understand browser security constraints
3. **Given** different model configurations (GPT-5, Codex variants), **When** the agent loads prompts, **Then** it applies the appropriate base instructions for that model family while maintaining web-specific behavior
4. **Given** a request requiring page interaction, **When** the agent plans its approach, **Then** it references DOM operations, tab management, and browser storage instead of file system operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the prompt references unavailable terminal tools?
- How does system handle model families not explicitly configured for web use?
- What occurs if prompt loading fails during agent initialization?
- How does the agent respond to queries requiring file system access it doesn't have?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST convert the terminal-based system prompt (gpt_5_codex_prompt.md) to web-agent specific instructions
- **FR-002**: System MUST replace all file system and shell command references with equivalent web operations (DOM manipulation, navigation, network interception)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain the same prompt loading architecture as codex-rs (model family support, base instructions pattern)
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate the prompt into the agent's message construction pipeline matching codex-rs patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST support model-specific prompt variations (GPT-5-codex, standard models) as done in codex-rs
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear instructions about available web tools (DOMTool, TabTool, NavigationTool, FormAutomationTool, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST adapt sandboxing and approval concepts to browser security context (origin policies, permissions)
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the prompt's structure for presenting work and formatting responses
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle prompt loading failures gracefully with fallback to default instructions
- **FR-010**: System MUST support runtime prompt updates without requiring extension reload [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is hot-reload of prompts required?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **System Prompt Template**: Web-specific version of gpt_5_codex_prompt.md containing browser operation instructions
- **Model Family Configuration**: Mapping of model types to their appropriate base instructions (web-adapted)
- **Prompt Loader**: Component responsible for loading and composing full instructions from base + user instructions
- **Web Tool Descriptions**: Documentation of available browser tools replacing terminal commands
