# Feature Specification: AgentConfig Integration Fix

**Feature Branch**: `003-agentconfig-is-the`
**Created**: 2025-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AgentConfig is the centralized config object that help control, however, it is not correctly implemented on the AgentConfig usage, in codex-study/codex-chrome/src/core/CodexAgent.ts, we've seen a lot of initialization has this.config as parameter, but we even don't see the construction method that adopt the config param in origial class implementation. For example: In line 45 of CodexAgent.ts this.session = new Session(this.config); But in codex-study/codex-chrome/src/core/Session.ts we totally don't see related Session class is accepting the config param. There are many other similar errors as well inspect the code and fix all the bug of the code: bring the AgentConfig to the real usage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the codex-chrome extension, I need the AgentConfig configuration object to properly propagate configuration settings to all components that require them, so that the system behavior can be consistently controlled through centralized configuration management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** CodexAgent is initialized with an AgentConfig object, **When** Session is created, **Then** the Session should receive and utilize the configuration settings from AgentConfig
2. **Given** CodexAgent is initialized with an AgentConfig object, **When** ToolRegistry is created, **Then** the ToolRegistry should receive and utilize the configuration settings from AgentConfig
3. **Given** CodexAgent is initialized with an AgentConfig object, **When** ApprovalManager is created, **Then** the ApprovalManager should receive and utilize the configuration settings from AgentConfig
4. **Given** AgentConfig settings are updated during runtime, **When** configuration change events are emitted, **Then** all dependent components should respond to configuration changes appropriately
5. **Given** ModelClientFactory needs to be initialized, **When** initialize method is called with config, **Then** the factory should properly store and use the configuration for creating model clients

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AgentConfig is not provided to CodexAgent constructor?
- How does system handle when required initialize methods don't exist on components?
- What occurs when config parameters are passed but constructors don't accept them?
- How does system behave when config change events are emitted but components aren't subscribed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST properly pass AgentConfig to Session constructor when creating new Session instances
- **FR-002**: System MUST properly pass AgentConfig to ToolRegistry constructor when creating new ToolRegistry instances
- **FR-003**: System MUST properly pass AgentConfig to ApprovalManager constructor when creating new ApprovalManager instances
- **FR-004**: Components that receive AgentConfig MUST store and utilize the configuration for their operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST add missing initialize methods to components that are called with config parameter but don't have the method
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure ModelClientFactory can properly initialize with AgentConfig
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure ToolRegistry can properly initialize with AgentConfig
- **FR-008**: Components MUST be able to subscribe to and handle configuration change events from AgentConfig
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for components that can work without explicit config
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide default configuration values when AgentConfig is not explicitly provided

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AgentConfig**: Centralized configuration object that manages all system settings and emits change events
- **CodexAgent**: Main agent class that orchestrates all components and should propagate config to them
- **Session**: Conversation session manager that should receive and use config for its operations
- **ToolRegistry**: Tool management system that should receive and use config for tool initialization
- **ApprovalManager**: Approval policy manager that should receive and use config for approval decisions
- **ModelClientFactory**: Factory for creating model clients that should use config for client initialization
