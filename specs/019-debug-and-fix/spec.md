# Feature Specification: Content Script Communication Fix

**Feature Branch**: `019-debug-and-fix`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "debug and fix content js problem for DOM tool, currently the content js is not working correctly to respond to DOM TOOL in codex-chrome/src/tools/DOMTool.ts, in the codex-chrome/ app runtime, the method ensureContentScriptInjected() line: const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, { type: MessageType.PING }); got following error: Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist. We need to debug why the the content js side is not working"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Error: "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist"
   ‚Üí Location: DOMTool.ts ensureContentScriptInjected() method
   ‚Üí Component: Content script communication between background and content script
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Actors: Background script (DOMTool), Content script (content-script.ts), MessageRouter
   ‚Üí Actions: Send PING message, receive PONG response, establish communication channel
   ‚Üí Data: MessageType.PING/PONG messages, chrome.tabs.sendMessage API
   ‚Üí Constraints: Content script must be loaded and message listener must be registered
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Timing issue: Content script may not be fully initialized when PING sent

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
When an AI agent attempts to interact with a web page (query DOM elements, click buttons, fill forms), the system MUST establish reliable communication between the browser extension's background process and the web page's content script. The user should not experience "connection failed" errors when the agent tries to perform page interactions.

**Current Problem**: Users receive an error message "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" when the AI agent attempts to use DOM tools to interact with web pages.

**Expected Behavior**: The agent can successfully send commands to the content script and receive responses, allowing seamless page interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a browser extension is installed and a web page is loaded,
   **When** the agent attempts to query page elements (e.g., "find all links on the page"),
   **Then** the communication channel establishes successfully and the agent receives the requested data

2. **Given** a fresh page load,
   **When** the agent sends its first DOM command within 100ms of page ready,
   **Then** the content script responds successfully without connection errors

3. **Given** a page with multiple iframes or complex JavaScript,
   **When** the agent sends DOM commands,
   **Then** the content script responds from the correct execution context

4. **Given** the content script has been idle for several minutes,
   **When** the agent sends a new DOM command,
   **Then** the existing message listener responds without needing reinjection

5. **Given** a page navigation occurs (soft navigation in SPA),
   **When** the agent sends DOM commands after navigation,
   **Then** the content script remains responsive without reinitialization

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the page loads very slowly or has CSP (Content Security Policy) restrictions?
- How does system handle pages that navigate immediately after load?
- What happens if the content script throws an error during initialization?
- How does system behave on privileged pages (chrome:// URLs) where content scripts can't run?
- What happens during rapid successive DOM commands?
- How does system handle browser background tab throttling?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Communication Reliability**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST establish bidirectional communication channel between background script and content script within 500ms of content script injection
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect when message listener is not responding and provide clear error message to user
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify content script readiness before attempting DOM operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle "receiving end does not exist" errors gracefully without crashing the agent

**Content Script Lifecycle**:
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure content script message listener is registered before page interaction begins
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist message listener across page lifecycle events (DOMContentLoaded, load, interactive states)
- **FR-007**: System MUST reinitialize content script if message listener becomes unavailable
- **FR-008**: Content script MUST announce its presence to background script after successful initialization

**Error Recovery**:
- **FR-009**: System MUST retry failed connection attempts with exponential backoff (already implemented, must verify it works)
- **FR-010**: System MUST differentiate between "not loaded yet" and "failed to load" scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide actionable error messages indicating whether issue is injection failure, listener failure, or page restrictions
- **FR-012**: System MUST log diagnostic information (timing, page state, listener status) when connection fails

**Manifest & Injection**:
- **FR-013**: System MUST verify content script file path matches manifest configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST support both declarative (manifest-based) and programmatic (chrome.scripting.executeScript) injection
- **FR-015**: System MUST avoid duplicate injections that could cause multiple message listeners
- **FR-016**: System MUST work on all non-privileged web pages (http://, https://, file://)

**Testing & Verification**:
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a health-check mechanism (PING/PONG) that confirms listener is active
- **FR-018**: Health-check MUST complete within 100ms on responsive pages
- **FR-019**: System MUST expose diagnostic commands for developers to verify content script state

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Background Script (DOMTool)**: Initiator of page interactions; sends commands and expects responses; handles retries and errors
- **Content Script**: Runs in web page context; receives commands via message listener; executes DOM operations; sends results back
- **Message Channel**: Chrome extension messaging API; carries PING/PONG health checks and DOM command/response payloads
- **MessageRouter**: Message routing infrastructure; registers listeners; wraps/unwraps message format; manages async responses
- **Page Context**: Web page execution environment; content script must be injected and initialized before operations can proceed

## Problem Analysis (Context for Planning Phase)

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The error "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" indicates one of:
1. Content script file not injected (file path mismatch - unlikely, fixed in feature 018)
2. Content script injected but initialization failed (error during initialize() function)
3. Message listener not registered (MessageRouter.setupMessageListener() failed or not called)
4. Message listener registered to wrong context (background vs content source mismatch)
5. Timing issue (chrome.tabs.sendMessage called before content script listener ready)

### Expected Behavior
- Content script loads ‚Üí initialize() called ‚Üí MessageRouter created ‚Üí setupMessageListener() registers chrome.runtime.onMessage listener ‚Üí PING handler registered ‚Üí responds to PING with PONG
- Current behavior: PING sent ‚Üí chrome.tabs.sendMessage error ‚Üí "receiving end does not exist"

### Diagnosis Required
System must identify which step in the initialization chain is failing by:
- Verifying content script file loads (check console for "Codex content script initialized" log)
- Verifying MessageRouter creation (check if router variable is set)
- Verifying listener registration (check if chrome.runtime.onMessage has listener)
- Verifying handler registration (check if PING handler exists in handlers Map)
- Verifying timing (ensure content script has time to initialize before PING)

### Success Metrics
- Connection establishes successfully on 99%+ of page loads
- Average initialization time < 200ms
- Zero "receiving end does not exist" errors on supported pages
- Clear error messages for unsupported pages (chrome://, etc.)
- Agent can perform DOM operations immediately after page becomes interactive
