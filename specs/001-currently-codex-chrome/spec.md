# Feature Specification: Terminal-Style UI for Codex Chrome Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-currently-codex-chrome`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "currently codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs/, turning the terminal agent code into chrome extension based agent. The agent use svelte page in side panel of extension. Now we want to turn the UI into terminal like style: with black background and green font color by default, and for some important information, use yellow or red color. Do some research on any existing tailwind package we can use to do the terminal like UI, if not, just use tailwind to create such UI style"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Codex Chrome Extension, I want the agent interface in the side panel to have a terminal-like appearance that matches the command-line aesthetic of the original Codex terminal agent, providing a familiar and visually consistent experience while maintaining clear visual hierarchy through color coding for different types of information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Chrome extension side panel is opened, **When** the user views the interface, **Then** the background should be black and the default text should be green to mimic a terminal environment
2. **Given** the agent displays regular output or responses, **When** the text appears, **Then** it should be rendered in the default green color for standard readability
3. **Given** the agent displays important information or warnings, **When** such content is shown, **Then** it should be rendered in yellow to draw user attention
4. **Given** the agent displays errors or critical alerts, **When** such messages appear, **Then** they should be rendered in red to indicate severity
5. **Given** a user types input or commands, **When** viewing their input, **Then** the text should be clearly distinguishable from agent responses [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should user input have a different color or style?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user has system-wide high contrast mode enabled?
- How does the interface handle color accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies?
- What is the fallback appearance if custom styling fails to load?
- How should code blocks or formatted content appear within the terminal theme?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all UI elements with a black background to create a terminal-like environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST render standard text content in green color by default
- **FR-003**: System MUST render important informational messages in yellow color for emphasis
- **FR-004**: System MUST render error messages and critical alerts in red color for urgency
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent terminal-style typography [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific font family - monospace, specific terminal font?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all text remains readable with sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply the terminal theme consistently across all UI components in the side panel
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to read all content clearly regardless of the color coding used
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve the terminal aesthetic when displaying [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what content types - code blocks, tables, lists, links?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle text overflow and wrapping in a terminal-appropriate manner [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: word-wrap behavior, horizontal scrolling?]

### Visual Design Requirements
- **VR-001**: Interface MUST use a consistent color palette based on traditional terminal colors
- **VR-002**: Color usage MUST follow a clear hierarchy: green (default), yellow (important), red (critical)
- **VR-003**: Interface MUST maintain visual consistency with terminal emulator conventions
- **VR-004**: Typography MUST support clear character distinction for terminal-style display
