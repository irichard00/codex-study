# Feature Specification: Remove Legacy State from Session

**Feature Branch**: `007-remove-the-legacy`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "remove the legacy state from Session in codex-chrome/src/core/Session.ts. currently codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs/, turning the terminal based coding agent into chrome extension based web agent that operate the webs. We follow the session implementation of codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs to implement SessionState, which makes the legacy State object not useful anymore, this task is to remove the legacy State object and migrate session logic to use SessionState only in codex-chrome/src/core/Session.ts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: remove State class, migrate to SessionState
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Session class, State class, SessionState class
   ‚Üí Actions: remove, migrate, refactor
   ‚Üí Data: conversation history, turn state, token usage, approved commands
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain backward compatibility, preserve functionality
3. Mark unclear aspects: None - clear refactoring task
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Verify all State methods have SessionState equivalents
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. No key entities (code refactoring, not data modeling)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details needed for spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the codex-chrome extension, I need the Session class to use only SessionState for state management, removing the legacy State class, so that the codebase follows the architecture from codex-rs and avoids duplicate state management logic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Session instance with conversation history, **When** methods are called to access history, **Then** data is retrieved from SessionState instead of legacy State
2. **Given** a Session with token usage tracking, **When** tokens are added, **Then** only SessionState tracks the usage (not both State and SessionState)
3. **Given** a Session managing approved commands, **When** commands are approved or checked, **Then** SessionState handles all command approval logic
4. **Given** an existing Session export/import workflow, **When** sessions are exported and imported, **Then** data persistence works using SessionState format only
5. **Given** Session methods that delegated to legacy State, **When** those methods are called, **Then** they delegate to SessionState or implement logic directly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when importing old session exports that still use legacy State format?
  - System MUST support backward compatibility for legacy exports during import
- How does system handle conversations with large history during migration?
  - System MUST preserve all conversation items without data loss
- What happens if SessionState is missing functionality that State had?
  - System MUST verify feature parity before removing State

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove all references to the legacy State class from Session.ts
- **FR-002**: System MUST migrate all state management logic to use SessionState exclusively
- **FR-003**: Session MUST delegate conversation history operations to SessionState
- **FR-004**: Session MUST delegate token usage tracking to SessionState
- **FR-005**: Session MUST delegate approved command management to SessionState
- **FR-006**: Session MUST support importing legacy session exports (backward compatibility during import only)
- **FR-007**: Session MUST export using SessionState format only (no legacy format in new exports)
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality during refactoring
- **FR-009**: Session MUST remove duplicate state tracking (currently tracking in both State and SessionState)
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain all existing Session public API methods (no breaking changes to interface)
