# Feature Specification: Refactor Session.ts to Match Rust Implementation Updates

**Feature Branch**: `004-refactor-session-ts`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor Session.ts to catch up the original session implementation update in rust: codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract requirement: synchronize TypeScript Session with Rust Session updates
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: Session structure changes, state management split, service layer separation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific Rust updates should be prioritized?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Verify Session maintains SQ/EQ architecture
   ‚Üí Ensure type safety and protocol consistency
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (Session, SessionState, SessionServices, TurnContext)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec assumes access to full Rust codebase for comparison"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Chrome extension developer, I need the TypeScript Session class to mirror the architectural improvements made in the Rust implementation so that the browser-based agent maintains feature parity, reliability, and consistency with the terminal version.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Rust Session has been refactored to separate state management, **When** the TypeScript Session is updated, **Then** it must maintain the same state separation pattern (SessionState, SessionServices, ActiveTurn)

2. **Given** the Rust implementation tracks conversation history through ConversationHistory, **When** recording messages in TypeScript, **Then** history must be managed consistently with token tracking and compaction support

3. **Given** the Rust Session manages turn lifecycle with ActiveTurn mutex, **When** implementing turn management in TypeScript, **Then** concurrent turn handling must prevent race conditions

4. **Given** MCP tools are integrated in Rust via SessionServices, **When** calling tools from TypeScript, **Then** the same tool interface and error handling must be preserved

5. **Given** the Rust implementation uses RolloutRecorder for session persistence, **When** exporting/importing sessions in TypeScript, **Then** the format must remain compatible for cross-platform session resumption

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a session is interrupted mid-turn and state needs to be recovered?
- How does the system handle concurrent message recording and history compaction?
- What occurs when MCP connection managers fail to initialize in the TypeScript environment?
- How are token limits and rate limits tracked when the context window is exceeded?
- What happens when attempting to resume a session created in Rust within the Chrome extension?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Session Structure & State Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST separate session state into distinct layers: SessionState (history, token info, approved commands), SessionServices (MCP, exec, rollout, notifications), and ActiveTurn (current turn state)

- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain conversation history using ConversationHistory class with support for recording items, history snapshots, and replacement operations

- **FR-003**: System MUST track token usage information including total tokens consumed, model context window limits, and rate limit snapshots

- **FR-004**: System MUST manage approved commands in a persistent set that survives turn boundaries

**Turn Lifecycle Management**
- **FR-005**: System MUST support atomic turn state transitions: start turn, end turn, interrupt turn, and abort turn

- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent concurrent turn execution by maintaining at most one active turn at any time

- **FR-007**: System MUST handle pending input during turn execution, allowing interruption and queueing of new user input

- **FR-008**: System MUST track turn context including current working directory, approval policy, sandbox policy, model selection, and tool configuration

**Service Integration**
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate MCP connection manager for Model Context Protocol tool discovery and execution

- **FR-010**: System MUST support exec session management for command execution and shell interaction [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Chrome extension may need web-specific exec replacement]

- **FR-011**: System MUST provide rollout recording for session persistence, replay, and debugging

- **FR-012**: System MUST deliver user notifications through a consistent notifier interface

**History & Persistence**
- **FR-013**: System MUST support history compaction to manage token consumption within model context windows

- **FR-014**: System MUST enable session export including conversation history, turn context, state, and metadata

- **FR-015**: System MUST enable session import from exported data with backward compatibility for older formats

- **FR-016**: System MUST support session resumption from previously saved rollout data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: format compatibility between Rust and TypeScript]

**Tool Execution**
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide MCP tool discovery returning available tools with their definitions

- **FR-018**: System MUST execute MCP tools with parameter validation and error handling

- **FR-019**: System MUST track tool usage statistics for monitoring and debugging

- **FR-020**: System MUST handle tool execution errors gracefully with appropriate event emission

**Configuration & Initialization**
- **FR-021**: System MUST initialize with configuration including model provider, reasoning settings, approval policy, sandbox policy, and working directory

- **FR-022**: System MUST validate configuration parameters including absolute path requirement for working directory

- **FR-023**: System MUST support parallel initialization of independent services (MCP, rollout, shell discovery) to reduce startup latency

- **FR-024**: System MUST handle initialization failures for optional services without blocking session creation

### Key Entities

- **Session**: Primary orchestration class managing conversation lifetime, turn execution, and service coordination. Contains conversation ID, event emitter, state mutex, active turn mutex, and service collection.

- **SessionState**: Immutable snapshot of session-wide persistent state including conversation history, approved commands, token usage info, and rate limit data.

- **SessionServices**: Collection of external service interfaces including MCP connection manager, exec session manager, user notifier, rollout recorder, and shell configuration.

- **TurnContext**: Configuration for a single turn execution including model client, working directory, instructions, approval/sandbox policies, tool configuration, and review mode flag.

- **ActiveTurn**: Mutable state for the currently executing turn including task kind, submission ID, abort handle, and pending state changes.

- **ConversationHistory**: Ordered collection of conversation items (messages, tool calls, responses) with metadata for timeline tracking and compaction support.

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - focused on architecture
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - feature parity with Rust
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - describes system capabilities
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - **3 clarifications needed**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - session export/import, turn lifecycle, state separation
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Session class refactoring only
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - requires Rust codebase access

**Outstanding Clarifications:**
1. Which specific Rust updates should be prioritized for the initial refactor?
2. Should Chrome extension replace exec with web-specific operations?
3. Must session format be fully compatible between Rust and TypeScript for cross-platform resumption?
