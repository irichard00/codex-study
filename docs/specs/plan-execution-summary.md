# Plan Execution Summary

## Execution Details
- **Branch**: feature/codex-chrome--is-converted-from-codex-rs---turning
- **Date**: 2025-09-24
- **Status**: COMPLETE ✓

## Context Applied
The codex-chrome skeleton already exists with basic infrastructure. The implementation plan was adjusted to focus only on missing components rather than starting from zero.

## Generated Artifacts

### Phase 0: Research and Analysis
- **File**: `/home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/research.md`
- **Content**: Analysis of codex-rs architecture and identification of components to port

### Phase 1: Design and Architecture
- **File**: `/home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/data-model.md`
- **Content**: TypeScript type definitions preserving Rust protocol names
- **File**: `/home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/contracts/api-contracts.md`
- **Content**: API contract specifications for all components
- **File**: `/home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/quickstart.md`
- **Content**: Developer quickstart guide

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
- **File**: `/home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/tasks.md`
- **Content**: Detailed implementation tasks (T001-T037) with dependencies and parallel execution guidance

## Key Findings

### Existing Components (Already in codex-chrome)
1. Basic project structure with Vite, TypeScript, Svelte
2. Core files: CodexAgent.ts, Session.ts, MessageRouter.ts, QueueProcessor.ts
3. Protocol type definitions partially implemented
4. Background service worker and content script stubs
5. Side panel UI with Svelte

### Missing Components to Implement
1. **ModelClient** - OpenAI and Anthropic API clients
2. **TaskRunner** - Task execution orchestration
3. **TurnManager** - Conversation flow management
4. **ToolsRegistry** - Tool registration and dispatch
5. **BrowserTools** - Tab, DOM, Storage, Navigation tools
6. **ApprovalManager** - User consent handling
7. **DiffTracker** - Change monitoring system

## Implementation Approach

### Preserved from codex-rs
- SQ/EQ (Submission Queue/Event Queue) architecture
- Exact type names from Rust protocol
- Core message flow patterns

### Adapted for Chrome Extension
- File operations → Browser operations (tabs, DOM, storage)
- Shell commands → Chrome extension APIs
- Sandboxing → Chrome's built-in security model

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation following tasks.md (T001-T037)
2. Start with tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
3. Focus on missing components while leveraging existing skeleton
4. Maintain test-driven development approach

## Validation Gates
✓ Research complete - codex-rs architecture analyzed
✓ Design approved - TypeScript types and contracts defined
✓ Tasks complete - 37 executable tasks generated

## Implementation Ready
All planning phases complete. Ready to begin implementation of missing components using the existing codex-chrome skeleton.
