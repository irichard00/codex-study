# Implementation Plan: ModelClient Alignment Refactoring

## Metadata
- Input: /home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/20250925-complete-codex-chrome-implementation.md
- Output: Implementation artifacts in /home/irichard/dev/study/codex-study/docs/specs/
- Status: COMPLETE
- Execution Date: 2025-09-25
- Branch: feature/currently-codex-chrome--is-converted-from-codex-rs

## Technical Context
Aligning the TypeScript ModelClient implementation with the Rust version by:
- Analyzing both codex-rs/core/src/client.rs and codex-chrome/src/models/OpenAIClient.ts
- Identifying gaps in SSE processing, ResponseEvent types, rate limiting, and token tracking
- Creating a phased refactoring plan to achieve feature parity
- Using API key authentication instead of OAuth flow

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Phase 0: Research and Analysis
- [x] Phase 1: Design and Architecture
- [x] Phase 2: Implementation Planning

## Execution Summary

### Phase 0: Research and Analysis ✅
**Completed Artifacts:**
- `research-modelclient.md` - Comprehensive gap analysis between Rust and TypeScript implementations

**Key Findings:**
1. TypeScript implementation lacks OpenAI Responses API support
2. Missing 12+ SSE event types from Rust implementation
3. No rate limit tracking or header parsing
4. Token usage tracking incomplete (no cached/reasoning tokens)
5. Retry logic uses fixed jitter instead of proportional

### Phase 1: Design and Architecture ✅
**Completed Artifacts:**
- `data-model-modelclient.md` - Complete TypeScript type definitions
- `contracts/modelclient-api.md` - API contracts and interfaces
- `quickstart-modelclient.md` - Developer quick start guide

**Design Decisions:**
1. Preserve exact type names from Rust for consistency
2. Use discriminated unions for ResponseEvent types
3. Implement SSEEventParser as separate class
4. Extend existing StreamProcessor for event handling
5. Create dedicated OpenAIResponsesClient for Responses API

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning ✅
**Completed Artifacts:**
- `tasks-modelclient.md` - 24 detailed implementation tasks

**Task Breakdown:**
- **Phase 1 Tasks (Foundation)**: 4 tasks, ~12 hours
- **Phase 2 Tasks (SSE Processing)**: 4 tasks, ~20 hours
- **Phase 3 Tasks (Responses API)**: 4 tasks, ~24 hours
- **Phase 4 Tasks (Enhanced Features)**: 6 tasks, ~20 hours
- **Phase 5 Tasks (Polish)**: 6 tasks, ~16 hours

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~92 hours (2.5-3 weeks with 1 developer)

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation
- Implement core types (ResponseEvent, TokenUsage, RateLimits)
- Update retry logic with proportional jitter
- Set up test infrastructure

### Week 2: SSE Processing
- Build comprehensive SSE event parser
- Port process_sse function from Rust
- Integrate with existing StreamProcessor
- Create mock SSE streams for testing

### Week 3: Responses API
- Implement OpenAIResponsesClient
- Add request/response types
- Create Prompt interface
- Build integration tests

### Week 4: Enhanced Features
- Add rate limit management
- Implement token usage tracking
- Create authentication layer
- Optimize performance

### Week 5: Polish & Documentation
- Complete error handling
- Add request queuing
- Update documentation
- Performance optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **SSE Complexity**: Mitigated by incremental implementation and thorough testing
2. **Browser API Limitations**: Use polyfills and fallbacks where needed
3. **Breaking Changes**: Implement behind feature flags
4. **Performance Impact**: Profile and optimize hot paths

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental implementation with feature flags
- Comprehensive test coverage (target 80%)
- Performance benchmarking at each phase
- Regular code reviews

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All 15+ SSE event types handled
- ✅ Token usage tracking with cached/reasoning tokens
- ✅ Rate limit headers parsed and tracked
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ API key authentication implemented

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ SSE processing < 10ms per event
- ✅ Memory usage < 50MB for streams
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ 80% test coverage
- ✅ Chrome extension compatible

## Generated Artifacts Summary

### Research Phase
- `research-modelclient.md` - Gap analysis and technical constraints

### Design Phase
- `data-model-modelclient.md` - Complete type definitions
- `contracts/modelclient-api.md` - API specifications
- `quickstart-modelclient.md` - Implementation guide

### Planning Phase
- `tasks-modelclient.md` - 24 detailed tasks with dependencies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Create feature branch if not exists
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for new code
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation (TASK-001 through TASK-004)

### Long-term Considerations
1. Plan for GPT-5 model support
2. Consider WebSocket upgrade for better streaming
3. Evaluate Worker threads for SSE processing
4. Design for extensibility with new providers
