# Implementation Tasks: [FEATURE_NAME]

## Overview
[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]

## Task Execution Order

### Phase 1: Setup & Testing Infrastructure
These tasks establish the foundation and test harness.

[SETUP_TASKS]

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
These tasks can be executed in parallel groups.

[CORE_TASKS]

### Phase 3: Integration
These tasks wire everything together.

[INTEGRATION_TASKS]

### Phase 4: Polish & Documentation
Final tasks for production readiness.

[POLISH_TASKS]

## Parallel Execution Examples

Group 1 - Initial setup (run these first):
```bash
# Can run in parallel with Task agent
T001 [P]
T002 [P]
T003 [P]
```

Group 2 - Core components (after setup):
```bash
# Different files, can parallelize
T010 [P]
T011 [P]
T012 [P]
```

## Task Dependencies
- Setup tasks must complete before core tasks
- Core tasks must complete before integration
- Tests can run in parallel with their implementations

## Notes
- Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel
- Each task specifies exact file paths
- All tasks are self-contained and executable
