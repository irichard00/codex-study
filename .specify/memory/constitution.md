# Project Constitution

## Core Principles
1. **Preserve Architecture**: Maintain the SQ/EQ (Submission Queue/Event Queue) pattern from codex-rs
2. **Type Safety**: Enforce strict TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
3. **Browser Security**: Comply with Chrome Extension Manifest V3 security model
4. **User Privacy**: Never expose user data or API keys

## Technical Standards
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Development Guidelines
- Test-driven development where possible
- Document all public APIs
- Keep components loosely coupled
- Prefer composition over inheritance
