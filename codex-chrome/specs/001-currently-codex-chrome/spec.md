# Feature Specification: Config Refactoring for Chrome Extension

**Feature Branch**: `001-currently-codex-chrome`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "currently codex-chrome/ is converted from codex-rs/, turning the terminal agent code into chrome extension based agent, we've found the config implementaion from codex-rs/core/src/config.rs is not aligned with the implementation in codex-chrome/, scan through both codex-rs/ and codex-chrome/ and bring refactor of code related to config in codex-chrome. The config should remove unnecessary part for chrome extension, for example, mcp_servers config is no necessary for chome extension, analyze other configs as well to check if it is necessary."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identify: config misalignment between codex-rs and codex-chrome
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Chrome extension users, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: refactor config, remove unnecessary parts
   ‚Üí Data: configuration settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: Chrome extension environment limitations
3. Analyze current implementations:
   ‚Üí codex-rs has comprehensive config.rs with many terminal-specific settings
   ‚Üí codex-chrome has minimal config, mostly API keys in ModelClientFactory
4. Identify required config refactoring:
   ‚Üí Remove terminal-specific configs
   ‚Üí Adapt to Chrome extension storage model
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be Chrome extension compatible
6. Identify Key Entities for Chrome config
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Chrome extension user, I want the Codex agent to have a properly configured settings system that aligns with Chrome extension capabilities and storage mechanisms, so that I can configure the agent behavior without unnecessary terminal-specific options cluttering the interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user installs the Codex Chrome extension, **When** they access settings, **Then** they see only Chrome-relevant configuration options
2. **Given** a user configures API keys and model preferences, **When** they restart the browser, **Then** their settings persist through Chrome's storage sync
3. **Given** a developer maintains the codebase, **When** they compare config between codex-rs and codex-chrome, **Then** the Chrome version contains only extension-appropriate settings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Chrome storage quota is exceeded?
- How does system handle migration from old config format to new?
- What happens when sync conflicts occur between devices?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide configuration management appropriate for Chrome extension environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove terminal-specific configurations (mcp_servers, shell environment policies, sandbox settings, file system paths)
- **FR-003**: System MUST store user preferences using Chrome storage API (sync/local)
- **FR-004**: System MUST retain essential model configuration (API keys, model selection, provider settings)
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove approval policies not applicable to browser environment
- **FR-006**: System MUST exclude file system dependent features (project documentation paths, AGENTS.md loading, codex_home directory)
- **FR-007**: System MUST exclude terminal UI specific settings (TUI notifications, paste burst detection)
- **FR-008**: System MUST retain and adapt web-appropriate settings (model parameters, reasoning settings, verbosity)
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to configure multiple model providers and switch between them
- **FR-010**: System MUST exclude history file persistence to local filesystem
- **FR-011**: System MUST remove Linux sandbox and shell command execution configs
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide migration path for users updating from current implementation

### Key Entities
- **ChromeConfig**: Core configuration object containing only Chrome-appropriate settings
- **ModelConfig**: Model provider settings including API keys, endpoints, and model selection
- **UserPreferences**: User-configurable options like model choice, verbosity, reasoning effort
- **StorageManager**: Handles persistence to Chrome storage APIs instead of filesystem
